# Cronjobs - a Bonfire Module

This is a simple cron module that should be compatible with Bonfire 0.7 (though it hasn't been test recently). It was created for another project that was based on an early development version of 0.7. It's here because a couple of people were asking about a cron module so it's here to provide a starting point. In time we can build this up to something excellent and powerful.
